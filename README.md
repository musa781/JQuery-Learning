# JQuery-Learning
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library designed to simplify client-side scripting of HTML. It provides easy-to-use APIs for tasks such as:

DOM manipulation: Select and modify HTML elements and content.

Event handling: Manage user interactions like clicks and keypresses.

AJAX: Load data asynchronously without refreshing the page.

Animations and effects: Create dynamic transitions and visual feedback.

jQuery significantly reduces the amount of code needed compared to vanilla JavaScript and ensures cross-browser compatibility.
